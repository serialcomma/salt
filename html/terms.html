            <h1>Terms of Use</h1>

            <p>Serial Comma LLC welcomes you to the Singapore Acts and Legislation Tracker website (SALT). SALT provides information about, and links to, selected Singapore laws and related legal materials.</p>
            <p>These Terms of Use provide important information about your visit to SALT. Please read this page carefully.</p>
            <p>The SALT Privacy Policy at <a href="http://www.omniquity.com/salt/html/privacy_policy.html">http://www.omniquity.com/salt/html/privacy_policy.html</a> also applies to your visit to SALT. The Privacy Policy informs you of our practices concerning our collection and use of your personal data when you use SALT. Please read the Privacy Policy carefully, too.</p>
            <p>Serial Comma owns the SALT website at www.omniquity.com/salt/html. By using SALT, you agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you must not use SALT.</p>
            <p>If you agree to these Terms and the Privacy Policy, you may view the content and click the links in SALT according to these Terms. You must not use SALT in any other way. You must not use SALT for any unlawful purpose or in any way these Terms prohibit. Your rights under these Terms are non-exclusive, non-transferable, and revocable. We reserve all rights in SALT not granted to you in these Terms.</p>

            <h2>Not Legal Advice</h2>
            
            <p>SALT is for general information only and is not legal advice. Serial Comma is not a law firm. If you want legal advice on any topic covered in SALT, please seek the assistance of a qualified lawyer.</p>
            
            <h2>Site Content</h2>

            <p>SALT mostly contains links to selected Singapore legal materials. Serial Comma does not control the sites linked to, the content on those sites, or the treatment of your personal data by those sites. We do not endorse those sites and are not associated with the operators of those sites, most of which are Singapore government agencies. The terms of use and the privacy policies of those sites, not these Terms or the Privacy Policy, govern your rights and obligations regarding those sites and their content. You are responsible to review the terms of use and privacy policies of those sites.</p>
            <p>Serial Comma owns all original content on the SALT website, including text, the SALT logo, graphic elements, and the look and feel of the website. We do not claim any rights in the titles of government materials, other government information, or materials attributed to third parties that we present on SALT. These Terms do not grant you any ownership or other rights in the content on SALT.</p>
            <p>You agree to respect the copyright and other rights of Serial Comma and the owners of other content on SALT by not copying, making different versions of, distributing, publicly performing, or publicly displaying any content on SALT.</p>
            
            <h2>Your Obligations</h2>
        
            <p>You must not use SALT in any manner that could damage, disable, or impair SALT or interfere with any other persons’s use of SALT. You must not access SALT with a bot or other means intended to replace a human’s direct interaction with SALT. You must not obtain or attempt to obtain any content from SALT by any means not provided by SALT. You must not reverse engineer or attempt to discover the source code of SALT except as the law permits.</p>
            <p>SALT is hosted on servers in the USA. You agree to comply with all laws that apply to you when you access and use SALT.</p>
            <p>You agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Serial Comma and our members, officers, employees, agents, licensors, and suppliers from all claims, losses, costs, liabilities, and expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees) relating to or arising out of your use of or inability to use SALT or your violation of these Terms, any rights of a third party, or any laws. We may, at our own cost, assume sole control of the defense of any matter for which you must indemnify us, in which case you will fully cooperate with us in asserting any available defenses.</p>

            <h2>Termination</h2>
            
            <p>Serial Comma may at any time, for any reason or no reason and without notice or liability to you, terminate your access to SALT and the license granted to you in these Terms. Your indemnity obligations, our liability disclaimers, the governing law and arbitration clauses, and each party’s rights that accrued before termination will survive termination of these Terms for any reason.</p>

            <h2>Liability Disclaimers</h2>
            
            <p>You agree to accept all risks related to your use of SALT. Serial Comma provides SALT on an ‘as is, as available’ basis. We believe content on SALT is accurate as of the revision date of the page on which it appears. However, the sites SALT links to may change often and without notice. We do not guarantee that the content on SALT is accurate, complete, or up to date when you view it, nor do we accept responsibility for any loss if you rely on it to act or refrain from acting. We do not promise to update the content on SALT.</p>
            <p class="text__bold_red">Serial Comma disclaims all warranties and conditions regarding SALT, including warranties that SALT will meet your requirements or will be uninterrupted, secure, free of harmful components, or error-free, and all implied warranties and conditions of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement.</p>
            <p class="text__bold_red">You agree that, to the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Serial Comma and our members, officers, employees, agents, licensors, and suppliers will not be liable for any direct, indirect, punitive, incidental, special, consequential, or other damages of any kind, whether based on contract, tort, negligence, strict liability, or otherwise, even if foreseeable or advised of the possibility of damages, incurred by you or anyone claiming through you, in connection with SALT; the use of, inability to use, or results of using SALT, any websites SALT links to, and any content on SALT; or any claim by a third party that your use of SALT or any content on SALT violates the rights of any third party, including intellectual property rights.</p>

            <h2>Governing Law; Arbitration</h2>
            
            <p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy are governed by the laws of the State of Wyoming, USA, regardless of the law that might otherwise apply under applicable principles of conflicts of law.</p>
            <p>Any dispute or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or concerning its existence, validity, breach, or interpretation, whether based on contract, tort, or other legal theory and including claims of fraud or misrepresentation, will be determined by arbitration administered by the International Centre for Dispute Resolution according to its International Expedited Procedures regardless of the amount in dispute. A single arbitrator will hear all disputes. The seat of arbitration will be Wyoming, USA, and the arbitration will be conducted in English in Denver, Colorado, USA. Consistent with the nature of expedited arbitration, pre-hearing information exchange will be limited to the reasonable, expeditious production of relevant non-privileged documents explicitly referred to by a party to support relevant facts presented in its case. Evidence will be taken by the submission of documents only. The arbitration award will be final and binding on the parties. Except as may be required by law, neither party nor its representatives may disclose the existence, content, or results of the arbitration without the prior written consent of both parties. Each party retains the right to seek judicial assistance to compel arbitration and to enforce any decision of the arbitrators including the final award.</p>

            <h2>General Terms</h2>
            
            <p>If any provision of these Terms is unenforceable, that provision will be deemed to be deleted and the enforceability of the remainder of these Terms will not be affected.</p>
            If we choose not to enforce these Terms against you when you breach them, or if we choose not to exercise a right we have in these Terms, we have not waived our rights to do so in the future.</p>
            <p>These Terms do not grant rights to any third parties except as stated in the indemnity and liability disclaimer clauses.</p>
            <p>These Terms and the Privacy Policy contain the entire agreement between you and Serial Comma relating to this subject and supersede all earlier agreements, arrangements, and understandings between you and us, whether oral or written, relating to this subject.</p>

            <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
            
            <p>Serial Comma may change these Terms at any time. The most current version of these Terms supersedes all previous versions.
